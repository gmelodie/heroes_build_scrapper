# Players
This is like a contributors file, but for some reason "players" seemed like a more appropriate name.

The format here is

```
* [Nick (may include battle tag)](https://github.com/your-username)
```


* [LTKills#1331](https://github.com/LTKills)
* [Maskinen#2589](https://github.com/mtenmann)
